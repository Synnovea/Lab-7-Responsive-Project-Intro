          <p>Honestly, looking at tese amazing photos by Alexandria that
            she takes of her family are truly beautiful and amazing. Once
            I knew we would be doing an assignment on creative art, I just
            knew I had to bring these photos to other people's attention
            if they had not seen them yet. I hope you are transported to a 
            time where you believed in magic like I have after viewing these
            photos. Hoping that one day I can achieve something as beautiful
            as this one day.

            <p>Alexandria, who is the creator of these photos, is a self-taught photographer.
              (Crazy great for her!!!) She loves creating magical photos with her husband and
              her three lovely children. A you can see from the images, she lovs to take classic
              fairytales that she might have told her children, and that we have probably heard of
              growing up, and incorporated them in her photos. Who wouldn't want to be in a real-life 
              fairytale?
